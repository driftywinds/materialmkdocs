I've been doing this a while and there are already some great resources you can check out for all sorts of links (like [fmhy](https://fmhy.pages.dev)). Despite those, I wanted to curate a bunch of links that I myself have come to depend upon for my needs. 

These are the categories available for now: -

### - [Movies / TV Shows](TV/links.md)
### - [Music / Audibooks](music/links.md)

If you use my builds or something I host and want to support me you can check these out : - (even as low as 0.5 USD or 40 INR would help)
