# About Me

I am a 24 year old law graduate from India, and I do sysadmin stuff along with everything on here as a hobby.

## How this came to be

### Hosting Stuff
My journey with linux on VPSs started with discovering Oracle Cloud's free tier plans. I am a big fan of this indie game called [Bombsquad by Eric Froemling](https://ballistica.net/) and I really wanted to host my own customised server for it. This led me to downloading the windows builds of the server but I realised I didn't want it to shut down when I shut my PC so I got Oracle's free tier. I did not know anything about linux or the command line, and having to figure out how to install python3 and then tar the archive containing the server binary was tough and confusing but eventually I managed to run it, and the server, called "Vanilla FFA" was quite successful. 

Anyway, I then used my curiosity to learn how docker containers worked so that I could host an instance of Vaultwarden for myself (which is still up to this day and I use it daily), and the rest is history. I have since learnt to setup a bunch of stuff on my virtual machines on Oracle Cloud.

### Building Modified Apps

I have also always been a pirate and an avid user of GitHub, so when the ReVanced project came around after the death of Vanced, I learnt how to compile builds for myself and my friends and family. Being on Reddit, though, I saw demand for the builds because alot of people did not know how to make the builds themselves to I started releasing my builds on there for whoever needed it, and with time I learnt to use custom branding and a custom package name for my builds for authenticity and identification purposes. In the begining of 2024, one of my dearest friends decided to switch to an iPhone and this prompted me to look into modified YouTube apps for iOS as well. After some research I learnt ALOT about uYouEnhanced, YTLitePlus, iOS Sideloading, IPA decryption... the whole shebang. Then, for my friend I started building uYouEnhanced too and following the same principle as before, started sharing it with the internet.

### Using GitHub to its full potential

GitHub was never about the repositories of code it hosted initially - it was only about the release page of many different projects for me. I only understood the capabilities and potential of GitHub (like GitHub pages and GitHub Actions with environment variables etc.) very recently when I got deep into building ReVanced patches, and hosting small static web-apps myself. The free offerrings of GitHub really gave me new wind to explore and that is how I have now started using the provisions of my account more. My [progress bar project](https://progress.003274.xyz/year) is a recent one that is hosted on github pages entirely. From knowing absolutely nothing about anything, to hosting, building and sharing so much, I'm confident this will never die down as a hobby for me.
