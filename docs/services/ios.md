# iOS

I mainly deal with sideloading on a very surface level that too.

## AltStore Source Viewer

- I run [this](https://github.com/therealFoxster/altsource-viewer) project on my own [here](https://view.drifty.win).

## Repositories (AltStore, Esign, TrollApps)

- I update my [AltStore Repository](https://003274.xyz/altstore) regularly whith a bunch of usefull sideloadable apps.

	Pure JSON link to this is - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/driftywinds/driftywinds.github.io/master/AltStore/apps.json`
- [Balatro IPA file](https://github.com/driftywinds/balatro-builds/releases/latest)

## Mirrors / Backups

- Mirrors to some stuff exist as a file server [here](https://files.drifty.win) and on Telegram [here](https://003274.xyz/megalomania).
