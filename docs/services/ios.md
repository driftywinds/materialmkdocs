# iOS

I mainly deal with sideloading on a very surface level that too.

## AltStore Source Viewer

- I run [this](https://github.com/therealFoxster/altsource-viewer) project on my own in two versions - [GitHub pages version](https://ios.drifty.win) and [Cloudflare Pages version](https://view.drifty.win).

## Repositories (AltStore, Esign, TrollApps)

- I update my [AltStore Repository](https://view.drifty.win/view/?source=https://driftywinds.github.io/AltStore/apps.json) regularly whith a bunch of usefull sideloadable apps.

	Pure JSON link to this is - `https://driftywinds.github.io/AltStore/apps.json`

- If the AltStore Repository does not work already, I have dedicated repos for [ESign](https://driftywinds.github.io/repos/esign.json) and [TrollApps](https://driftywinds.github.io/repos/trollapps.json) too.
- I have an alternate AltStore repo specifically for [YTLitePlus](https://driftywinds.github.io/repos/YTLPaltstore.json).

## Mirrors / Backups

- Mirrors to all of the above exist as a file server [here](https://files.drifty.win) and on Telegram [here](https://t.me/+rvcObIvOpctiMDI9).

## Useful links for sideloading
