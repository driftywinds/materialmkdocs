# Android

I mainly deal with patching and releasing the latest version of modified YouTube (ReVanced, RVX or ReX).

## GitHub Releases

I host barebones repositories that are compatible with [Obtanium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) for automatic updates on Android phones. They are as follows: -

- [YouTube builds](https://github.com/driftywinds/yt-builds)
- [YouTube Music builds](https://github.com/driftywinds/ytm-builds)
- [MiXplorer releases](https://github.com/driftywinds/mixplorer-releases)

## Telegram Releases

- YouTube builds - [here](https://t.me/YTRXbuilds) or in the ReVanced builds topic [here](https://t.me/+rvcObIvOpctiMDI9)
- Spotify builds from xManager (essentially a repost channel) - [here](https://t.me/crackedspotifymod)
- Minecraft (MCPE) with working online - [here](https://t.me/mcperelease)

## Reddit / Lemmy Releases

- I release my YouTube builds for people who are not super tech savvy and rely on Reddit for updates [here](https://new.reddit.com/r/revancedapks) as a fallback (I am u/fakedoorsarereal).
- I also release them on Lemmy regularly [here](https://lemmy.ml/c/revancedapks).

If you use my builds or something I host and want to support me you can check these out : - (even as low as 0.5 USD or 40 INR would help)
