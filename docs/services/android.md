# Android

I mainly deal with patching and releasing the latest version of modified YouTube (ReVanced, RVX or ReX).

## GitHub Releases

I host barebones repositories that are compatible with [Obtanium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) for automatic updates on Android phones. They are as follows: -

- [YouTube builds](https://github.com/driftywinds/yt-builds)
- [YouTube Music builds](https://github.com/driftywinds/ytm-builds)
- MiXplorer releases (to be established)

## Telegram Releases

- Latest releases of modified YouTube builds are available to download on my dedicated Telegram channel [here](https://t.me/YTRXbuilds) or in the ReVanced builds topic [here](https://t.me/+rvcObIvOpctiMDI9).
- Latest releases of modified Spotify builds from xManager (essentially a repost channel) are available [here](https://t.me/crackedspotifymod). 
- Latest releases of Minecraft (MCPE) with working online can be found [here](https://t.me/mcperelease).

## Reddit / Lemmy Releases

- I release my builds for people who are not super tech savvy and rely on Reddit for updates [here](https://new.reddit.com/r/revancedapks) as a fallback (I am u/fakedoorsarereal).
- I also release builds on Lemmy regularly [here](https://lemmy.ml/c/revancedapks).
