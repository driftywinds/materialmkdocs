### Links to projects

Everything in this section is the fruits of my labour and my experience in learning how to setup stuff on docker or compile builds etc. You can check them out by clicking on them in the sidebar or checking them out from here: -

- [Android](android.md)
- [iOS](ios.md)
- [Deta Space (DEPRECIATED)](deta.md)
- [Miscellaneous](misc.md)
