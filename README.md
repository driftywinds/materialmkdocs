## My Docs!
This repo will exactly reproduce my docs site using Material for MkDocs with every new commit.
This is also my way of figuring out how to do documentation for my stuff for the longterm in an aesthetic way.

### What are the .ps1 and .exe files?
The exe is a build of the .ps1 script file that automates serving, and building & pushing of the site to your respective places. THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND BEFORE USING: -

- mkdocs needs to be installed and your site needs to be initialized properly already
- git needs to be installed and initialized with your repo, so that the script can commit and push to it. The format of commit names is ```([datetime]('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'))```
